In this project, a grocer is looking to rearrange their produce section and 
need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective
layout for the customer. Our tasks as developers are to:

1. Produce a list of all items purchased in a given day aalong with the number
of tiems each item was purchased.
2. Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased
in a given day.
3. Produce a text-based histogam listing all items purchased in a given day,
along with representation of the number of times each item was purchased.

I feel that I do a good job of keeping my code clean and clear and try to use the 
class coding standard methods. I could enhance my code by including more specific
notes to explain the functions of each block. I found this entire project to be 
challenging and had to utilize many resources for assistance. I was also having 
issues with the IDE so I wasn't able to see if it was fully functional. Understanding
the IDE more thoroughly would help me considerably in coding projects.

Learning C++ has been challenging for me and I do find other languages (python/java)
to be a bit easier for me. However taking this course has helped to expand my knowledge
in programming languages so that can better understand the history, concepts, and 
differences in programming languages, while adding to my arsenal of tools available in
future career endeavors and projects.
